				    <h2>Synopsis</h2>
				    <p>
				    	Pebble is a Java templating engine which originally started as a port of <a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org/">Twig</a>. 
				    	It uses modern paradigms such as inheritance and composition to maximize code reuse, it uses
				    	a Django inspired syntax for excellent readability, and it
				    	compiles all templates into Java bytecode for optimal performance. 
				    </p>

					<h4>Simple Logic</h4>
				    <p>
				    	Pebble gives you the ability to iterate through collections,
				    	use <code>if</code> statements, and test variables for certain
				    	qualities all with a very concise and easy-to-read syntax. Pebble provides
				    	only the minimal amount of logic necessary to create dynamic 
				    	templates while avoiding the burden of carrying too much of your 
				    	business logic.
				    </p>
    			</div>
    			<div class="col-md-4">
    				<p class="primary-feature-icon"><i class="fa fa-copy fa-5x"></i><p>
					<h4>Inheritance</h4>
				    <p>
				    	The most important feature that makes Pebble stand out from
				    	the crowd is the ability for templates to inherit from each other. Write
				    	your structure or scaffolding code once, and then extend from that template
				    	to reuse it over and over again. Create chains of inheritance to maximize 
				    	this potential.
				    </p>
			   </div>
			   <div class="col-md-4">
			   		<p class="primary-feature-icon"><i class="fa fa-th fa-5x"></i><p>
					<h4>Composition & Macros</h4>
				    <p>
				    	Import the entire rendered output of one template into another with one simple
				    	statement. If you want more fine grained control, you can write
				    	"macros" which are lightweight reusable elements that can be used anywhere.
				    </p>

					<dt>Filters & Tests</dt>
					<dd>There are numerous built in filters that allow you to quickly abbreviate text, 
				    	capitalize words, format dates, provide defaults to 
				    	null values, and much more. Beyond filters there are also "tests"
				    	to check if your variables are null, even, odd, iterable, etc. 
			    	</dd>
			    	<dt>Extensibility</dt>
					<dd>Pebble was built with the philosophy that it should 
						be able to adapt to any project. Create your own tags, filters, tests, 
						functions, and even operators. Feel free to also use your own template loader
						implementation as well as your own template cache. It's <em>your</em> application so do it 
						<em>your</em> way.
			    	</dd>
			    	<dt>Performance</dt>
					<dd>Pebble templates work very well in highly concurrent environments. Using
						multiple threads for the evaluation of a single template allows for low
						latency evaluations.
			    	</dd>
			    	<dt>Documented</dt>
					<dd>All features are well documented with numerous examples. There are also recipes
						for some more advanced techniques.
